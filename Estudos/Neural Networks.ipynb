    "Even though a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture wasn't used in this study, a brief description of its working can be given to explain the basic mechanism of training and classification of general neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, the focus of this project. A rigorous explanation can be found at (citação).\n",

    "A MLP is structured by the interconnection of fundamental units called _perceptrons_, organized within a layered structured. Each perceptron is a set of free parameters which is applied to a given input, passing forward a value. All parameters can be adjusted by a learning proccess so that the network becomes capable of returning a expected final output for each input obtained from a training dataset.\n",

    "Formally, consider a network with $L$ layers, each layer with $D_l \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$ neurons, $l = 1, \\ldots, L$. Hence, each layer has as its outputs a vector from $\\mathbb{R}^{D_l}$, and each layer's parameters can be described as a weight matrix $W^l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D_l} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{D_{l-1}}$ with bias $b^l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D_l}$. If $X = \\{ x_1, \\ldots, x_N\\}$ is a dataset, $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D_1} \\forall i = 1, \\ldots, N$, and $a^l$ denotes the output of layer $l$ to $l+1$, then\n",

Usually, the network is adjusted using optimization methodologies based on the Mean-Squared Error (MSE) and through algorithms such as the Back-Propagation, that propagates backward the relative error from the last layers, adjusting each layer recursively.
